# DrawQL

DrawQL allows you to to prototype, visualize, and collaborate on a new or existing GraphQL API and then export it as usable code. Since GraphQL API's contain tons of information, DrawQL allows for clear visual relationships so you can see all the connections in the API. Once your prototype is built, export it as code and easily implement it into your own application so you can get back to coding. The team aspect of DrawQL allows users to collaborate on a single prototype so every team member knows exactly what they are working with throughout the development process.
